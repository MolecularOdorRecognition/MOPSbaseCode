This folder contains 4 files:
- runStep1.py
- runStep2.py
- runStep3.py
- runVaryDrop.py

The first three may be explained in detail via the Project Report generated for the BTech Training of Arpit Mathur (RSDC6991 GitHub handle)
alongwith an explaination to the NN aproach itself.

runStep1:    computes multiple models with variation on NN hidden layer size
runStep2:    computes multiple models with variation on NN batch size
runStep3:    computes multiple models with variation on NN dropout rate
runVaryDrop: computes a model with variation on dropout rates on a randomly selected NN hidden layer size and batch size.
